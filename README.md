# Flight Fare Prediction: 
●	After verifying the various features like type of Airline ,Source ,Destination ,route ,etc. I successfully predicted the flight price between two cities. Performed various regression algorithms & by using Hyperparameter Tuning, got an accuracy of 0.81%.

●	Created a Flask Framework for the model and successfully did model deployment on Heroku platform.

## Overview
This is a Flask web app which predicts fare of Flight ticket.

## Motivation
What to do when you are at home due to this pandemic situation? I started to learn Machine Learning model to get most out of it. I came to know mathematics behind all supervised models. Finally it is important to work on application (real world application) to actually make a difference.
